                <h2>J P Saxe</h2>
                <p>
                	The first time I heard about J P Saxe was when I heard one of my friends sing 25 in Barcelona. I really loved it and started listening to it. One of his recent songs "If the world was ending" which is with his girlfriend, another amazing singer Julia Michaels is just simply amazing.

                <h2>Finneas O'Connell</h2>
                <p>
                	Finneas O'Connell is Billie Eilish's brother and an amazing music director. The first time I heard him singing is in the song Break My Heart Again, which is a slow and beautiful song. After which I heard Lets fall in love for the night which became my favorite very fast.
